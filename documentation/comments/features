- if bibtex file is available then skip pdf parsing 
ISBN 
 - vial full text query
 - via regular queryBuilder
 
 - use top to limit results (e.g. top <= 200) 
 - omit parameters
   authorFont, authorFontRelation : if authorFont not specified then authorFontRelation is ignored
   - now omitting both results in no author parsing
   same for authorHeightMin/Max : if authorHeightMin/Max is omitted then authorHeigth is assumed to be used
 - AllUpperCase gets all text in upper case
 - get maximum height on page for use with titleHeight
 - get title :
   - page
   - get first text on page (join subsequent lines with very similar font)
   get author :
   - page
   - get second text on page
     - since often authors are spread over several subsequent lines:
       - that cab furthermore can contain different fonts, e.g. in the case of capitalized names (e.g. C.Walther or Cohen, first letter
         capitalized)
       - use advanced join operation
