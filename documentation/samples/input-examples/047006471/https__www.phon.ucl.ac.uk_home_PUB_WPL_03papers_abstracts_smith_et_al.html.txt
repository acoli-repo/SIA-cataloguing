UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003)  Dissociation of social affect andtheory of mind in a case of Asperger syndrome NEIL SMITH, BEATE HERMELIN &IANTHI TSIMPLIWe report on a case of Aspergersyndrome (KH), who has considerable linguistic ability with a verbal IQ of 153.Strikingly, he readily and correctly identifies the use of sarcasm, showingmastery of the meta-representation and dissociation characteristic of ‘interpretiveuse’. Current theories of the syndrome largely agree on the constellationof properties which define it, but disagree on whether the basic cause residesin a deficit in Theory of Mind or in a social and emotional deficit. We suggestan account in a ‘quasi-modular’ version of the modularityhypothesis, as developed by Smith and Tsimpli. Wespecify a range of quasi-modules (including Theory of Mind and SocialInteraction, itself divided into Social Cognition and Social Affect); weoutline the structure of the Emotional component, including basic and derivedemotions; and we then spell out some of their inter-connections and their relationto the Language Faculty. Our tentative conclusion is that all these componentsmay dissociate, and that high intelligence, combined with linguistic ability,may mask a deficit in Theory of Mind, though not in Social Affect.[PDF file]
