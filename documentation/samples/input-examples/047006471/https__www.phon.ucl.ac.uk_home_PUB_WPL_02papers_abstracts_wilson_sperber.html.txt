UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Relevance TheoryDEIRDRE WILSON & DAN SPERBERÂ This paper outlines the main assumptions of relevance theory(Sperber & Wilson 1985, 1995, 1998, 2002, Wilson& Sperber 2002), an inferential approach topragmatics. Relevance theory is based on a definition of relevance and twoprinciples of relevance: a Cognitive Principle (that human cognition is gearedto the maximisation of relevance), and a Communicative Principle (thatutterances create expectations of optimal relevance). We explain the motivationfor these principles and illustrate their application to a variety of pragmaticproblems. We end by considering the implications of this relevance-theoreticapproach for the architecture of the mind.[PDFfile]
