UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Quantifier spreading by English andKorean childrenHYU-KYUNG KANGThis paper argues that the phenomenon of quantifier spreading by young childrenhas to be analysed both cognitively and linguistically. Evidence comes from thefact that the visual input plays a key role in determining the children'sconceptual representation, suggesting the need for the central integration ofvisual and linguistic elements. In contrast, the fact that spreading iscommoner in the younger age groups and t hen gradually disappears is explicablein terms of the maturation of the linguistic system. It is claimed thatchildren initially treat quantifiers as modifiers, rather than functionalheads, and that quantifier spreading can be seen as one reason for th e developmental delay of therelevant functional category, DP, in language acquisition.
