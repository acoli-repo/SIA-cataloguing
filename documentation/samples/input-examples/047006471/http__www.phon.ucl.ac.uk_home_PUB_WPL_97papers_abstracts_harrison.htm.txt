UCLWPL 9 abstracts: HarrisonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)The relativecomplexity of Catalan vowels andtheir perceptual correlatesPHIL HARRISONDifferent phonological analyses of front-mid vowels can be seen to agree on onepoint: [e] is morecomplex than []. Support for the validity of this claim is potentially available from perceptualandacquisitional studies. The vowels of Catalan are described, and procedures detailed whichidentifyformant values for Catalan front-mid vowels. Empirical tests using native speakers andEnglishcontrols reveal prototypes for these vowels in vocalic space. No link between perception andcomplexity is observed, but the findings augur well for future work in acquisition.[PDF file]
