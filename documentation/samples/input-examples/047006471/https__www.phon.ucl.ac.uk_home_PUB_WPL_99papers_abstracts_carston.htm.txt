UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) The relationship between generativegrammar and (relevance-theoretic) pragmaticsROBYN CARSTON The generative grammar approach to language seeks a fully explicit account ofthe modular system of knowledge (competence) that underlies the human languagecapacity. Similarly, the relevance-theoretic approach to pragmatics attempts anexplicit characterisation of the subpersonal systemsinvolved in utterance interpretation. As an on-line performance system,however, it is subject to certain additional constraints; this is demonstratedby the way in which matters of computational (processing effort) economy arecurrently employed in the two types of theory. A sub-module of 'discoursecompetence' is shown to be compatible with and complementary to the widersystem of pragmatic processes.  [PDF file]
