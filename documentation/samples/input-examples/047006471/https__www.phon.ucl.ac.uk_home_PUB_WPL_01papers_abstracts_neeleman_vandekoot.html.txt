UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Bare resultatives AD NEELEMAN & HANS VAN DEKOOT Thispaper provides a complex-predicate analysis of resultativesin terms of bare phrase structure. Our main claim is that the predicate typesand thematic mapping rules required for simplex verbs can be used to explaincore properties of resultative constructions if a strict versions of Chomsky’s inclusiveness conditionis adopted. The analysis supports a view of subjects as external arguments inthe sense of Williams 1980, rather than as structurally defined, as in Stowell 1981,1983, Bowers 1993,etc.[PDF file]
