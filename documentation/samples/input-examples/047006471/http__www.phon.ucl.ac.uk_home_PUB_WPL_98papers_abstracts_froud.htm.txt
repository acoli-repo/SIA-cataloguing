UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Aphasic evidence for the syntacticdetermination of unaccusativity KAREN FROUD In this paper I introduce some data from an aphasic patientwho demonstrates a robust effect of grammatical class; he is unable to read anyfunction words, and makes characteristic 'within-category' substitution errors.These errors extend to the class of unaccusativeverbs, and this leads to a consideration of the functional nature of unaccusativity. Existing accounts of unaccusativityas a syntactic reflex of some semantic property are discussed, and a proposalfor a syntactic account of unaccusativity isoutlined. The aphasic deficit as we understand it seems to provide evidence infavour of a purely syntactic determination of unaccusativity.[PDF file]
