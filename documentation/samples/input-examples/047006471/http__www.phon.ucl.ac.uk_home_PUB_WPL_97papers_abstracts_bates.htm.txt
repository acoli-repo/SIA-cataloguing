UCLWPL 9 abstracts: Bates, Harris & WatsonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Prosody and melody in voweldisorderSALLY BATES, JOHN HARRIS & JOCELYNNE WATSONThe paper explores the syllabic and segmental facets of phonological vowel disorder. Theindependence of the two dimensions is illustrated by the case study of an English-speakingchildpresenting with a vowel impairment which can be shown to have a specifically syllabic basis.Hisrendition of adult long vowels displays three main patterns of deviance -- shortening,bisyllabification and the hardening of a target off-glide to a stop. Viewed phonemically, thesepatterns appear as unconnected substitutions and distortions. Viewed syllabically, however,theycan be traced to a single underlying deficit, namely a failure to secure the complex nuclearstructure necessary for the coding of vowel length contrasts.[PDF file]
