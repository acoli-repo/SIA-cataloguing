UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Don’t move! ANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITH  We consider head-movement, A¢-movement, and A-movement.We argue that of these three kinds of apparent movement, only head-movementexhibits displacement in any real sense, and that all three kinds of structureare made available directly by Merge. Merge itself is no longer implicitlyrestricted to function argument application, but isenriched to include other combinatorial operations derived from Combinatory Categorial Grammar. We argue that the re-interpretation of‘movement’ is not only possible, but desirable on empirical andconceptual grounds. We further consider why natural language should exhibitthese apparent displacements. [PDF file]
