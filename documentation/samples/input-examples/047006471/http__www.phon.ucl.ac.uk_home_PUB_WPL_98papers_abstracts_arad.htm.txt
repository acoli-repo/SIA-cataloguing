UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Psych-notesMAYA ARADObject Experiencer verbs areassumed to be a class apart, both semantically (i.e. they are specified as"psych", or contain an "experiencer"slot in their thematic grid) and syntactically (they differ syntactically fromstandard transitives, as argued by Belletti and Rizzi 1988). In thispaper I argue against both claims. I show that any position can be interpretedas an experiencer, and that sometimes the sameposition alternates between an experiencerinterpretation and that of a theme and a locative. Showing that the specialsyntactic behaviour of ObjExp verbs arises only ontheir stative reading, I suggest that the stative reading is headed by a lexical V head (rather thanfunctional v). ObjExp verbs thus shed light on somecentral questions in the domain of the syntax-lexicon interface: what lexicalproperties are syntactically relevant, how semantic changes are syntacticallyrealised, what kinds of VPs exist in the language, etc. [PDF file]
