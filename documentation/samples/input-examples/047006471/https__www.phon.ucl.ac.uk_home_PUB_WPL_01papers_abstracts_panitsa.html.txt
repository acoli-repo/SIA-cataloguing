UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Aspects ofaspect: Acquiring grammatical aspect in Modern Greek: The interaction of aspectwith aspectual adverbials in children’s grammarsGEORGIA PANITSA  This paper gives a detailed presentation of a study that wasconducted at a nursery school in Greece,with Greek subjects aged 1,9,19 to 4,3,15. Our elicited imitation task focusedon the acquisition of verbal aspect by Greek children, with particularreference to their comprehension of the semantics of perfective vs imperfective viewpoint aspect and to their ability tosuccessfully combine aspectual adverbials with verbs set for the perfective orimperfective aspectual value. Thus, the role of adverbial expressions in thedetermination of aspect in MG as well as the children's awareness and masteryof the system is examined. In respect of the positioning of aspectualadverbials in children’s grammars, we found that upon reproductionchildren had a strong preference to place them in a position immediatelyfollowing the verb irrespectiveof their position in the input. These findings were interpreted syntactically(following Cinque 1999) both in comparison with theadult grammar and also in terms of the acquisition of the semantics of aspectand of aspectual adverbials.[PDF file]
