UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) A morphological approach to the absenceof expletive PROPETER ACKEMA Whereas finite clauses can have impersonal readings, thispossibility appears to be universally excluded for clauses headed by aninfinitive. In other words, the understood subject of an infinitival clausemust always be interpreted as an argument and can never be expletive. In thispaper it is argued that this distinction between the two types of clause isultimately caused by a purely morphological factor, namely whether or not the inflectionon the verb that heads the clause is part of a paradigm or not. The analysis isbased on the hypothesis that inflection can function as the subject argument ofthe verb. The account of the properties of infinitival clauses is extended to aparticular class of languages in which the inflection on finite verbs is notpart of a paradigm either.[PDF file]
