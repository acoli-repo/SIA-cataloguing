Abstract: KrepsUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Dependency, licensing and the nature of grammatical relationsCHRISTIAN KREPSAbstractWord Grammar (Hudson 1984, 1990), in common with other dependency-based theories ofsyntax, seeks to express syntactic knowledge in terms of direct relationships between words.Dependency theories have traditionally recognised a large class of primitive grammaticalrelations (GRs), including Subject, Object and Adjunct, amongst others. In this paper I callintoquestion the status of these GRs, and argue instead that it is possible, and preferable, for adependency theory to be based on just one type of syntactic relation -- licensing. I suggest thatresidual properties of individual GRs can then be derived in a principled way from the simplestructures composed of licensing relations.[PDFfile]
