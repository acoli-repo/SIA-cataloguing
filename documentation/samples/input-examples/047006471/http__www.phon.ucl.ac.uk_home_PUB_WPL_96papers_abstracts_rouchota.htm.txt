Abstract: RouchotaUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Discourse connectives: what do they link?VILLY ROUCHOTAAbstractDiscourse connectives (e.g. but, moreover, therefore, so, etc.) have been analysedwithinthe coherence theory framework as linking units of discourse; within the relevance-theoreticframework they are seen as linking a unit of discourse and a context, which may be consistingof prior discourse but often is not. These two approaches are discussed and evidence, drawingon the syntactic and semantic properties of connectives as well as tests on conditions ofusage,is provided in support of the relevance-theoretic analysis.[PDFfile]
