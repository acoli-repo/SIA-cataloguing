UCLWPL 9 abstracts: BackleyUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Monovalency and the status ofRTRPHILLIP BACKLEY                                 Cases of ATR harmony are numerous and widely documented in the literature, whereaslanguagesin which RTR is harmonically active (e.g. Wolof) have received a good deal less attention. Adescription based on the bivalent feature [+/-ATR] is capable of representing both harmonytypes,but fails to encode naturally the clear difference in typological markedness separating the two.Onthe other hand, an Element Theory approach -- employing melodic headship as the basis oftongueroot distinctions -- is unable to provide an adequate account of RTR harmony withoutcompromising privativeness. In response, I propose a tier geometry analysis (Backley 1995)whichsucceeds in capturing the alternation facts of both ATR and RTR harmony systems, togetherwiththe markedness characteristics of each.[PDF file]
