In order toexplain this paradox, I propose that the two primes conventionally used to denote nasality andvoicing are identical, and that the difference is determined by the notion of headship: theheadedprime contributes voicing, and its headless counterpart manifests itself as nasality. Theseproposalsare presented within the context of Element Theory (Kaye et al. 1985; Harris& Lindsey 1995),where output representations are redundancy-free, refer only to privative primes, and are fullyinterpretable.[PDF file]
