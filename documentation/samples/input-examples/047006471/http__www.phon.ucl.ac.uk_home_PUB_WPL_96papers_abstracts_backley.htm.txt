Abstract: Backley & TakahashiUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Activate alpha: harmony without spreadingPHILLIP BACKLEY & TOYOMI TAKAHASHIAbstractIn most privative approaches to melodic structure, the only phonological operations deemedpossible are those involving the linking and delinking of primes. However, within an ElementTheory model where no independent ATR prime is recognized, this restriction must berelaxedin order to accommodate cases of tongue root harmony. In response, we propose a view ofmelodic structure in which every position contains a full set of elements; phonologicalcontrastsare then encoded by means of a lexical instruction to 'activate' individual primes. In this paperwedemonstrate how these assumptions can provide a satisfactory treatment not only of ATRharmony, but of vowel harmony in general.[PDFfile]
