Abstract: TzanidakiUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Configurationality and Greek clause structureDIMITRA IRINI TZANIDAKIAbstractThis paper discusses the issue of configurationality, with particular reference to Greek clausestructure and word order. First it offers an overview of phrase-structure approaches to wordorderand discusses issues related to stylistic movement and the configurationality parameter. ThenIgo on to present and critically evaluate existing accounts of Greek word order, focusing uponthedistinction between a configurational and a non-configurational approach to Greek clausestructure. My conclusion is that fully configurational approaches fail to account for a numberofdata, whereas existing GB-based  flat  accounts, which invoke a universal configurationalparameter, are incompatible with the latest evolutions of the Government and Binding Model,as instantiated by the Minimalist Program.[PDFfile]
