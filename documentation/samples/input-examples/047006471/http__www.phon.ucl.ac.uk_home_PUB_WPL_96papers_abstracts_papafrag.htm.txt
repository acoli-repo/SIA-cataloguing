Abstract: PapafragouUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)On genericsANNA PAPAFRAGOUAbstractIn this paper I argue against previous approaches to the semantics of generics which involvedthenotions of prototype, stereotype and relevant quantification. I assume that the logical form ofgenerics includes a generic operator which, as Heim (1992) has suggested, can be construedasthe modal operator of necessity. After demonstrating that the presence of the generic operatorina semantic representation, as well as its domain of quantification, are pragmatically supplied,Igo on to show how the various interpretations generics may receive can be successfullyaccounted for within a relevance-theoretic framework.[PDFfile]
