UCLWPL 9 abstracts: ItenUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Because and although: a case ofduality?CORINNE ITENKönig (1989) argues that there is a relation of duality between concessive and causalconstructions. Therefore, he maintains, any account of the meaning of causal connectives likebecause, via duality, also provides an account of the meaning of concessiveconnectives such asalthough. This paper lists a number of problems with König's account.Appealing to notionscentral to relevance theory, it will be argued that context plays an important role indeterminingthe propositions expressed by utterances of causal and concessive sentences. Because of thiscontext-dependence there cannot be said to be a semantic relation of duality betweenbecause andalthough.[PDF file]
