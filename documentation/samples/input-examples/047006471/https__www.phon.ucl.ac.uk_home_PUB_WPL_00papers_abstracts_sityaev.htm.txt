UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)The relationship between accentuationand information status of discourse referents: A corpus-based studyDMITRY SITYAEVThis paper presents empirical results of the corpus-based study on therelationship between accentuation and referent information status. It was foundthat there is no one-to-one relationship between “new” vs. “given” informationand presence vs. absence of accent. Contrary to the widely spread claim that“given” items appear to be deaccented, the results revealed that 79-89% ofcommon nouns and 89-97% of proper nouns which had been previously introducedinto the discourse surface as accented. Possible explanations for deaccenting“new” information and accenting “given” information are suggested. [PDF file]
