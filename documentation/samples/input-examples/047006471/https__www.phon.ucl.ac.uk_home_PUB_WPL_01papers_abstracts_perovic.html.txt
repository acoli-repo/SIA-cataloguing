UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)BindingPrinciples in Down syndromeALEXANDRA PEROVIC In an experiment designed to tap into knowledge of Bindingin individuals with Down syndrome (DS), it was found that subjects had specificdifficulties assigning appropriate interpretation to reflexives, traditionallyclaimed to be governed by Principle A of standard Binding Theory, as opposed topronouns, constrained by Principle B in the same framework. This pattern, notpreviously evidenced in the literature, is the reverse of the well known‘Delay of Principle B’ effect confirmed in typical acquisition. Thefindings suggest that the process of acquisition of Binding in DS may bequalitatively different compared to typical linguistic development, renderingthe traditional 'slow-but-normal' characterisation of language development inDS no longer tenable. Embracing the Reflexivity framework of Reinhart &Reuland (1993), I also argue that these findings reveal a specific syntacticdeficit in the language of DS, related to the inability to establish a certainsyntactic dependency, namely the binding relation between an anaphor and itsantecedent.[PDF file]
