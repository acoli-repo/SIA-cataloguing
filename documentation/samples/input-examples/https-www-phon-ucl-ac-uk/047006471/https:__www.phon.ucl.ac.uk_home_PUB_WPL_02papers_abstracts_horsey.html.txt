UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) The art of chicken sexingRICHARD HORSEY Expert chick sexers are able to quickly andreliably determine the sex of day-old chicks on the basis of very subtleperceptual cues. They claim that in many cases they have no idea how they make theirdecisions. They just look at the rear end of a chick, and ‘see’that it is either male or female. This is somewhat reminiscent of those expertchess players, often cited in the psychological literature, who can just‘see’ what the next move should be; similar claims have been madefor expert wine tasters and experts at medical diagnosis. All of these skillsare hard-earned and not accessible to introspection. Butis there really anything unusual about the chicken sexer,the chess grand master, the wine buff or the medical expert? I argue that thereis not. In fact,  weare all constantly making categorizations of this sort: we are highly accurateat categorizing natural kinds, substances, artefacts, and so on. We do soquickly and subconsciously, and the process is completely inaccessible tointrospection. The question is, why is it so difficultto acquire skills such as chicken sexing, when we automatically acquire theability to categorize other objects. In this paper, I argue that we havemechanisms for learning the cues necessary for categorization, but that thesemechanisms require selective attention to be given to the relevant features. Weautomatically acquire the ability to categorize certain objects because we haveinbuilt attention directors causing us to attend to diagnostic cues. In casessuch as chicken sexing, where we do not automatically develop categorizationabilities, our inbuilt attention directors do not cause us to attend todiagnostic cues, and out attention therefore has to be drawn to these cues inanother way, such as through training.[PDF file]
