UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) Relevance Theory and the constructionof idiom meaningROSA ELENA VEGA-MORENOThis paper proposes that the meaning a speaker intends inusing an idiom on a certain occasion is pragmatically (re)constructed on-lineby relevance-driven inferential mechanisms which take as input a set of highlyaccessible encyclopaedic assumptions from the concepts encoded by the idiomstring and its constituent words. The depth to which the encoded concepts areprocessed, in arriving at the (ad hoc) concept the speaker intends as acomponent of the explicature of her utterance,isÂ  constrained at every stage by thesearch for an optimally relevant interpretation.[PDFfile]
