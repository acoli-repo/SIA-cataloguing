Abstract: HudsonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)The difficulty of (so-called) self-embedded structuresRICHARD HUDSONAbstractWhy is it impossible to process The rat the cat the dog chased ate died? The standardexplanations all focus on its syntactic structure, but the present paper offers an alternativeexplanation in terms of semantic structure. The syntactic account cannot explain why somesentences which are syntactically similar are much easier to process. The difficult sentencesseemto be those in which an embedded clause which modifies a noun has its own subject modifiedby another clause whose subject is a common noun (not a pronoun). The explanation offeredhereis that the senses of the modified nouns are not sufficiently distinct to be maintained asseparateconcepts in short-term memory, so the various concepts stored 'interfere' with one another.[PDFfile]
