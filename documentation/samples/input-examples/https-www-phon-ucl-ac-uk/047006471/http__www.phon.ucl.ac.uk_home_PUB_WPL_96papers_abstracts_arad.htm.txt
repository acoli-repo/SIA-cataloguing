Abstract: AradUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)A minimalist view of the syntax-lexical semantics interfaceMAYA ARADAbstractThis paper presents a restrictive theory of the interface between the lexicon and the syntax. Iassume that only a limited amount of lexical information is available at the interface, and,following Borer (1994), that semantic (aspectual) interpretation is assigned at specifiers ofaspectual projections, rather than within the VP. Thus, the concept of "Mapping" fromlexiconto syntax or the "Linking" of arguments has no meaning in my theory. Instead, the syntaxnarrows down possible aspectual interpretations of predicates, and aspectual information attheinterface forms a constraint on the association of verbs with syntactic structures.
