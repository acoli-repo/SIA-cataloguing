UCLWPL 9 abstracts: Manzini & SavoiaUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Null subjects withoutproM. RITA MANZINI & LEONARDO M. SAVOIAWe argue that the notion of pro meets both empirical and theoretical difficultieswithin theminimalist framework of Chomsky (1995). We present an alternative theory which gives uppronominal empty categories, as well as DP-movement, in favor of an operation of featuremovement which relates thematic to inflectional positions. The proposed analysis iscompatiblewith a particularly simple formulation of the null subject parameter, which reinterprets strongandweak features as overtly realized and non-overtly realized features respectively, whileaccountingfor subject clitic varieties, such as Northern Italian dialects, as well as classical null subjectones,such as standard Italian.[PDF file]
