UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)The semantics/pragmatics distinction:a view from relevance theoryROBYN CARSTONThe assumption that sentence types encode proposition typeswas shaken by Donnellan's observation that a sentencewith a definite description subject could express either a general or asingular proposition. In other words, a single sentence type could havedifferent truth conditions on different occasions of use. Relevance Theoryholds a strong version of this "semantic underdeterminacy"thesis, according to which natural language sentences standardlyfall far short of encoding propositions or proposition types. Therelevance-driven pragmatic inferential mechanism is part of our "theory ofmind" capacity and functions independently of any code; it follows thatlinguistically encoded utterance meaning need be only schematic.
