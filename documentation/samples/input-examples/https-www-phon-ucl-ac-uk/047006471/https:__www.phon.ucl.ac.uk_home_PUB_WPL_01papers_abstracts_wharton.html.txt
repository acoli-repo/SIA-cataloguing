UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)NaturalPragmatics and Natural Codes TIM WHARTON Grice (1957) drew a famous distinction between natural(N) and non-natural(NN)meaning, where what is meant(NN) is broadly equivalent to what isintentionally communicated. This paper argues that Grice’s dichotomyoverlooks the fact that spontaneously occurring natural signs may beintentionally shown, and hence usedin intentional communication. It also argues that some naturally occurring behaviours have a signalling function, and that the existenceof such natural codes providesfurther evidence that Grice’s original distinction was not exhaustive.The question of what kind of information, in cognitive terms, these signalsencode is also examined.
