Abstract: BrehenyUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Pro-active focusRICHARD BREHENYAbstractThis paper applies a development of Sperber & Wilson's 1986 analysis of focus to interpretationalas well as interface issues. It also introduces the idea that procedural meaning can beembodiedin pro-active properties of a language. The paper takes a recent semantic approach to focus,thatof Rooth (1992, 1995), and draws out what theories of this kind leave to pragmatics toexplain.A pro-active analysis of focus couched in a relevance theoretic framework is shown to be abletoexplain judgements of unacceptability and falsehood contingent on the use of focus. It canexplainwhy focus associates strongly with certain operators and why focus triggers other kinds ofeffects,e.g. contrast. An analysis of post-nuclear material gives rise to an important generalisation:Predictability. This condition is shown to provide an explanation of certain interfacephenomenawhich is superior to that of Reinhart's interface strategy approach.[PDFfile]
