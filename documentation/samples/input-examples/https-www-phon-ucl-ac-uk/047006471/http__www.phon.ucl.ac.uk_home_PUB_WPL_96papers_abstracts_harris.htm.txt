Abstract: HarrisUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Phonological output is redundancy-free and fully interpretableJOHN HARRISAbstractBy attributing stand-alone phonetic interpretability to each melodic prime, we ridphonological output of segmental redundancy without compromising the ability ofrepresentations to be mapped onto articulation and auditory perception. Under this approach,the repertoire of constraints on segmental output is automatically restricted to those that referto lexically distinctive primes. One specific consequence is that there is no need formajor-class features. An analysis of glide hardening in Cypriot Greek demonstrates how[consonantal] can be jettisoned without jeopardizing the phonetic interpretability ofphonological representations.[PDFfile]
