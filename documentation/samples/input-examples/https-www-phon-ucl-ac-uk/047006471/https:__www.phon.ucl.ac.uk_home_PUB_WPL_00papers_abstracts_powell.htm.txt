UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Compositionality, innocence and theinterpretation of NPsGEORGE POWELLNeale (1999) outlines a theory of meaning which he claims can account for arange of problematic semantic data while respecting two intuitively plausibleconstraints on semantic theory: compositionality and semantic innocence. Inthis paper I argue that Nealeâ€™s theory, hindered as it is by its underlyingconception of the relation between language and thought, fails to satisfy thecriteria it sets for itself. Once this conception is abandoned, a new analysisbecomes available which accounts for the same semantic phenomena within a moreparsimonious framework, as well as respecting both compositionality andsemantic innocence, properly understood.
