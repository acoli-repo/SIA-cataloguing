Abstract: van de KootUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Strong features, pied-piping and the overt/covert distinctionHANS VAN DE KOOTAbstractThe purpose of this paper is to determine whether the different properties of the operationMovebefore and after Spell-Out can be grounded in independently motivated properties of theminimalist program. To this end I will address two potential problems for the requirementthatderivations must be uniform: (i) the obligatory nature of pied-piping prior to Spell-Out and(ii)the obligatory elimination of strong features prior to Spell-Out. If these problems cannot beaddressed in a satisfactory way, the motivation for the overt/covert distinction in theminimalistprogram is seriously undermined. I will show that the special properties associated with Movepre-Spell-Out can be derived from the economy condition requiring that an item enters thederivation only if it has an effect on output. Since it has recently been argued by Johnson andLappin (Johnson and Lappin 1996) that this economy condition gives rise to seriouscomplexityproblems when combined with the theory of QR proposed by Reinhart (1993, 1995), Iconcludethe paper with a discussion of these claims and show that they are unwarranted.[PDFfile]
