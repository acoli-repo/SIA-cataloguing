UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Investigating the impact of prosodiccomplexity on the speech of children with Specific Language ImpairmentCHLOE MARSHALL, SUSAN EBBELS, JOHN HARRIS & HEATHER VANDER LELYÂ Childrenwith Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have difficulty with, amongst otherthings, non-word repetition tasks. This paper presents preliminary researchinto the nature of the phonological deficit in SLI. We report results from fourSLI children tested on a new set of non-words which, unlike previous sets,takes metrical and syllabic complexity into account. Most errors occur innon-words with adjoined syllables. The implications of this finding for thenature of the phonological deficit in SLI, and its possible impact on syntacticand morphological abilities, are discussed.[PDF file]
