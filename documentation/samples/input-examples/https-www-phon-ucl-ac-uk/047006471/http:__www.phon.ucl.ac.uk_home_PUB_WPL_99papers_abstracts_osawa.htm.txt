UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) The relation between Tense and Aspect:The emergence of the T-systemFUYO OSAWAThe purpose of this study is to make clear the differences between tense andaspect and to show that T(ense),a functional category which heads a phrasal projection in the clause structure,comes to human languages later than aspect, both historically and in firstlanguage acquisition. That is, I suggest that there is a correlation betweenprocesses of first language acquisition and diachronic language change . This correlation is supported by currenttheoretical assumptions about functional categories, specifically TP. In theabsence of TP, the task of temporal interpretation can be taken care of byalternative devices such as temporal adverbials, aspect, and so on.  [PDF file]
