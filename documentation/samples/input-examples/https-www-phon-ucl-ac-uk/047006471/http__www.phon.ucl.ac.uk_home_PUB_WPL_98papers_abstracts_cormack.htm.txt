UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Negation, polarity and V positions inEnglish ANABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITH The distribution with respect to negation of verbs andauxiliaries in English needs a new analysis. Using data from the behaviour ofmodals, we argue for three negation positions: Echoic, Polarity, and Adverbial.The main claim we make is that Polarity Negation and Echoic Negation (and theirPositive counterparts) have a categorial feature [V]. This fact explains why averb cannot, but an auxiliary may, occur higher than Pol[NEG]. Soft constraintson the distribution of the Infl with which each [V]head must be associated determine the PF positions of the inflected heads. [PDF file]
