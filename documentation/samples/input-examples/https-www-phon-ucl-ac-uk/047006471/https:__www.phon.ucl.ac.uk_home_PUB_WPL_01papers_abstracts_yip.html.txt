UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Tonal features, tonal inventories and phonetic targets MOIRA YIP Mostwork on Asian languages uses two binary tone features. There are however casesin which the Register System cannot accurately characterize the phonetics ofthe recorded tones, particularly mid and contour tones. This paper identifiesthese problems, and sketches solutions. It proposes a new algorithm forconverting featural specifications into phonetic levels. Next, tonalinventories are analyzed within  an OTinstantiation of  Dispersion Theory.Finally it suggests that contours have only an initial tonal specification, andthe phonetic contour is the result of drift away from that initial target.Level tones have two targets, firmly anchoring both ends and keeping the pitchstable.[PDFfile]
