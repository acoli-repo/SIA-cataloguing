UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)The meaning of although: a Relevance Theoretic account CORINNE ITEN The meaning of concessive connectives like although isnotoriously difficult to capture, mainly because these connectives do notcontribute to the truth conditions of utterances containing them. In thispaper, a Relevance Theoretic account of the meaning of although is given. Theconnective is analysed as encoding procedural meaning, constraining theinferential side of utterance interpretation. The procedure encoded by althoughleads the hearer to recover certain contextual assumptions, which in turn giverise to contextual effects. In this way, the use of although reduces theprocessing effort involved in utterance interpretation. [PDF file]
