UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Age differences in the acquisition ofquantifiers: Evidence from English and KoreanHYE-KYUNG KANGThis paper reports experimental finding which shows age differences in theacquisition of universal quantifiers. From comparable experiments of Englishand Korean 4 to 7 year-old children, it was found that in both groups youngerchildren at the ages of 4 and 5 performed significantly better than the olderchildren at the ages of 6 and 7. This finding gives rise to the classic patternof a U-shaped developmental curve. On the view that some aspects of pragmaticsare mastered late in acquisition, later than syntactic knowledge, it is assumedthat the high rate of spreading errors by older children can be attributed tothe interference of pragmatic factors, rather than to lack of grammaticalknowledge. It is therefore argued that the errors made by younger children andthe errors made by older children have to derive from different sources: the formerare attributable to a deficiency of relevant grammatical knowledge, whereas thelatter are due to the interference of pragmatic factors, even though therelevant grammatical knowledge is available.
