UCLWorking Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Word-finalonsetsJOHN HARRIS& EDMUND GUSSMANNÂ A word-final consonant is standardlyassumed to occupy a syllable coda. An alternative is to treat it as the onsetof a syllable containing a phonetically unexpressed nucleus. The final-onsetanalysis is shown to out-perform the final-coda analysis on a range ofphonological phenomena, including syllable typology, stress, vowel length, andconsonant phonotactics. A constraint-based implementation of the final-onsetanalysis provides a straightforward treatment of the typological facts.[PDF file]
