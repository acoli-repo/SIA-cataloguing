First, it deals with the effect of verb movement and adjunction onthe optionality of complementizers; in this contextit offers an explanation of Sten Vikner'sgeneralisation that optional complementizers are only found in languageswithout obligatory verb movement. Second, the status of apparent verb-secondcomplement clauses in German is investigated. The theoretical background ofthis discussion is the comparison of theories of phrase structure with andwithout categorial projection.[PDFfile]
