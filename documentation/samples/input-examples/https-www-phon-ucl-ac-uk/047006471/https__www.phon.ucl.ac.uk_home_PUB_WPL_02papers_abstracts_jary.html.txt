UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Mood in relevance theory: a re-analysisfocusing on the Spanish subjunctiveMARK JARYÂ Accounts of non-interrogative mood in relevance theory have standardly assumed that what is encoded by these forms isinformation concerning the type of world they represent: actual, possible orpotential. This paper highlights some problems with this view when it isapplied to the indicative-subjunctive contrast in Spanish. An alternativeaccount is proposed which makes use of a distinction, already present inrelevance theory, between assumptions presented as relevant in their own rightand those which serve to facilitate the processing of the utterance. Acomparison with other accounts of the indicative/subjunctive contrast inSpanish is then made and broader implications for relevance theory arediscussed.[PDF file]
