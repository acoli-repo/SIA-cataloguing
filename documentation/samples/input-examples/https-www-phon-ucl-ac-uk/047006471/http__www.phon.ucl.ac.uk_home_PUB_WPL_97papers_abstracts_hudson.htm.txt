UCLWPL 9 abstracts: HudsonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Syntax without functionalcategoriesRICHARD HUDSONThis paper argues against the notion 'functional category' (a kind of word-class) whileacceptingthat individual words may be described as 'function' words or 'content' words. It focuses onthetwo least controversial examples of functional categories -- 'determiner' and 'complementiser'--and argues that neither of these categories is needed; and if this conclusion is correct, there isevenless independent support for the more abstract functional categories like 'Inflection' and itssubtypes. There is no word-class of 'determiners', because determiners are simply 'transitive'pronouns; nor do 'complementisers' comprise a word-class because the standardcomplementisersare all different from each other.
