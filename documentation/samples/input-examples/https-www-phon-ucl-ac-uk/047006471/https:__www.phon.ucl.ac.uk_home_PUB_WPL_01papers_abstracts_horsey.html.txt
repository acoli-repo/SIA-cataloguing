UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Psychosemantic analyticity RICHARD HORSEY  It is widely agreed that the content of a logical conceptsuch as AND is constituted by the inferences it enters into. I argue that it isimpossible to draw a principled distinction between logical and non-logicalconcepts, and hence that the content of non-logical concepts can also beconstituted by certain of their inferential relations. The traditional problemwith such a view has been that, given Quine’sarguments against the analytic-synthetic distinction, there does not seem to beany way to distinguish between those inferences that are content constitutiveand those that are not. I propose that such a distinction can be drawn byappealing to a notion of ‘psychosemanticanalyticity’. This approach is immune to Quine’sarguments, since psychosemantic analyticity is apsychological property, and it is thus an empirical question which inferenceshave this property. [PDF file]
