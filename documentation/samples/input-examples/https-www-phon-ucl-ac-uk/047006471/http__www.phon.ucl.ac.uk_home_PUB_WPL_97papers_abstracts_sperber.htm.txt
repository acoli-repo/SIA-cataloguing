UCLWPL 9 abstracts: Sperber & WilsonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)The mapping between the mental and thepublic lexiconDAN SPERBER & DEIRDRE WILSONThis paper considers the possible relations between mental concepts and public words, andarguesthat there are many more concepts in our minds than words in the language we speak. Theseconcepts may be both stable and communicable without being encoded in words. The conceptcommunicated by use of a word on a given occasion may go well beyond the conceptencoded.We show how these facts provide evidence against a code theory of communication and infavourof an inferential theory (relevance theory) whose implications for lexical semantics andpragmaticsare briefly explored.[PDF file]
