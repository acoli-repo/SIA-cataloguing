UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002)  Middle semantics and its realizationin English and Greek MARIA LEKAKOU In this paper Iexamine the realization of the notional category ‘middle’ in twotypes of languages, exemplified by English vs. Greek. The data indicate thatmiddles are parasitic on independently available structures: unergatives in the former, passives in the latter. Ipropose that the cross-linguistically distinct behaviourof middles is ultimately related to the different morphological means availableto the languages in question, and more specifically, to the (un)availabilityof imperfective aspect in the verbal morphology. The approach advocated hereimplies that there can be no syntactic notion of the ‘middle construction’and suggests a view of the syntax-lexical semantics interface contrary to thestandard ‘one-to-one’ correspondence.[PDF file]
