UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)On the status of representations andderivationsMICHAEL BRODYI reargue the point here that current mixed theories of syntax that involveboth derivations and representations are redundant and in principle lessrestrictive than their pure representational or pure derivational equivalents.Next I show that no pure derivational theory of narrow syntax exists. To beminimally adequate, derivational theories must be mixed, hence the argumentsagainst mixed theories apply to these too. In addition to this point I arguethat everything else being equal and with no additional stipulations added,derivational theories with the role of move are less restrictive thanrepresentational theories with the concept of chain. In the third section ofthe paper I consider the derivational explanation of the asymmetry of thenotion of c-command and conclude that this explanation, like other explanationsof c-command (and also like other derivational explanations) is not successful.I suggest instead that we should eliminate c-command from the grammar andreplace it by simpler interacting notions.
