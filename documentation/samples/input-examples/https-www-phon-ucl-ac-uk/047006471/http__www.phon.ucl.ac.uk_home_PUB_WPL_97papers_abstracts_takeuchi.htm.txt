UCLWPL 9 abstracts: TakeuchiUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Conceptual and procedural encoding:cause-consequence conjunctive particles inJapaneseMICHIKO TAKEUCHIA number of Japanese grammarians have proposed analyses of the causal connectives, KARAandNODE; however, these analyses do not appear to account in a fully adequate manner for thephenomena involved. This paper aims to clarify, using Sperber and Wilson's RelevanceTheory,their similarities and differences in meaning. It is argued that they encode both conceptualandprocedural information. On the conceptual level, KARA/NODE contribute to thetruth-conditionalcontent of an utterance, while on the procedural level they indicate where presupposition andfocus are to be found. I will argue that their conceptual semantics is identical, and that theydiffernly on the procedural level.[PDF file]
