UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Representingand processing idioms ROSA ELENA VEGA-MORENO This paper focuses on the way in which idioms are mentallyrepresented and how they are processed in on-line comprehension. The aim is todevelop an account of how hearers understand unfamiliar idioms, familiar idiomsand idiom variants. It will be argued that idiom meanings are represented andstored holistically in the form of structured phrasal concepts, and that theircomprehension is achieved through just the same processing mechanisms as thecomprehension of non-idiom strings. The account is grounded in two mainassumptions. First, our powerful inferential interpretive abilities enable usto create and understand concepts ‘on the fly’. Second, theutterance comprehension process, which often involves such ad hoc conceptconstruction, is regulated not by an expectation of literalness but by anexpectation of optimal relevance.[PDFfile]
