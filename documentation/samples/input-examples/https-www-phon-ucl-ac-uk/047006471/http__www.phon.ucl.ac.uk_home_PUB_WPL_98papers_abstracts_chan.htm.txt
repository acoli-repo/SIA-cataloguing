UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Functional heads, Cantonese phrasestructure and Cantonese-English code-switchingBRIAN, HOK-SHING, CHANThis paper is concerned with the idea that the morpho-syntax of intra-sentential code- switching isstrictly governed by the grammar of the matrix language/ML, whereas theembedded language/EL only contributes certain lexical elements within confinesset by ML. A particular model embodying this idea - the Lemma Congruence model(Myers-Scotton and Jake 1995) - is discussed. TheLemma Congruence model states that an EL word can appear in code-switchingprovided its lemma (i.e. morpho-syntactic properties)is congruent with its ML equivalents. I argue that the Lemma Congruence modelfails to explain recurrent patterns in Cantonese-English code-switching, wherevarious English (i.e. EL) forms may appear despite their"incongruence" with their Cantonese (i.e. ML) counterparts. As analternative, I suggest that code-switching may occur provided that thec-selection requirements of functional heads are satisfied. I argue that thelatter approach - which I call the Functional Head Selection approach - is notonly superior to the Lemma Congruence model, it also corroborates the idea thatintra-sentential code-switching and monolingual sentences are governed by thesame principles in Universal Grammar, a line of thought which has been exploredmost recently by MacSwan (1997) and Mahootian (1993).
