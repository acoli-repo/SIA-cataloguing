UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Beyond communicative intentionMARIE-ODILE TAILLARD Whileintentions are at the center of communicationtheories such as Relevance Theory, and also of theories of action in general,the interaction between communicative and non-communicative intentions has notbeen much investigated within the relevance-theoretic framework.  This paper discusses Bratman’s(1987) Theory of Planning, which recognizes the critical role of intentions ingoverning our actions, driving our practical reasoning, and enabling us tocoordinate with other individuals. I will argue that this theory can shed newlight on how a communicator’s non-communicative intentions can shape herutterances and affect her audience’s intentions, how the audience’sintentions may influence the comprehension process, and how audiences may copewith attempts at persuasion by considering the communicator’snon-communicative intentions.[PDF file]
