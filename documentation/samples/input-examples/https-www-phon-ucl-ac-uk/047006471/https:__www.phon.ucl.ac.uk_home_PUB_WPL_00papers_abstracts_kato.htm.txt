UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Functions of Japanese ga-clefts indiscourse: A relevance-theoretic approachMASAHIRO KATOThis article deals with the functional properties of Japanese ga-cleftsin news reports. The main points argued here are (i) that Amano’s (1995a, b)test framework which is designed to distinguish two options for ga-cleftsis not in fact sufficient to do so; (ii) that in the framework of RelevanceTheory, an alternative analysis can be proposed which claims that ga-cleftscan be adequately accounted for without appealing to the semantic/pragmaticnotions such as presupposition and focus, information structure, “direction ofspesificity” and so on; and (iii) that Japanese ga-clefts can beclassified into three subcategories.
