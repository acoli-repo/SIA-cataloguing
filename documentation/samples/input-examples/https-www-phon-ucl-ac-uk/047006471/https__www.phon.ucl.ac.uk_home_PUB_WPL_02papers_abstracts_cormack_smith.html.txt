UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Compositionality, copy theory, andcontrolANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITH Our ultimate concern is the mapping between representationsin the Language of Thought (in the sense of Fodor1975) and representations at LF in some version of the Minimalist Program(Chomsky 1995). We argue on a variety of grounds that such a mapping is directand that both these levels of representation must  meetthe (same) condition of compositionality. We argue that Copy theory, inparticular in the version exploited for 'control' phenomena by Hornstein (1999), is inimical to any such condition andmust therefore be rejected. The evidence comes from the properties ofquantified NPs in English and the Caucasian language Tsez.  Specifically we suggest a reanalysis of'backward control' in Tsez, as described by Polinsky & Potsdam (2001, 2002), thereby removing amajor argument for copy theory. Our analysis does not however preclude anassimilation of canonical control to raising, and weprovide an alternative to a Hornstein style analysis,giving some justification for the exploitation of the combinatorR in Combinatorial Categorial Grammar.[PDF file]
