UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) The syntax and semantics of causativeverbsJASPAR HOLMES In this paper I present a Word Grammar analysis of the syntax and semantics ofthe causative/inchoative alternation. The analysis makes crucial use of therelational network that characterises Word Grammar which provides for thedescription and explanation of the behaviour of regularly alternating verbslike BREAK as well as exceptionally non-alternating verbs such as VANISHand CUT. I also address the difference between inherently causativealternating verbs such as COLLECT and inherently inchoativealternating verbs such as GROW.  [PDF file]
