UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)A-not-Aquestions in CantoneseANN LAW By examining Cantonese A-not-A questions containingquantificational elements and on the assumption of the Minimalist framework(Chomsky 1995), I propose that an A-not-A question is formed by the movement ofthe question operator base-generated in sentential Neg0 head to [Spec,CP] to check the questionfeature in the head C0. (Cf. Cheng 1991, Chomsky 1995)  A reduplication of the verb or modalauxiliary immediately dominated by NegP is triggeredand inserted before the negative morpheme before Spell-Out. Adopting thisconfiguration, the ill-formedness of A-not-Aquestions containing elements of quantification in certain structural positionscan be explained by the violation of Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990).[PDFfile]
