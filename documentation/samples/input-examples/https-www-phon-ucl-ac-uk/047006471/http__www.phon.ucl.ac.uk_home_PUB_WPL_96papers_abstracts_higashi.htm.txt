Abstract: Higashimori & WilsonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Questions on RelevanceISAO HIGASHIMORI & DEIRDRE WILSONAbstractThe questions in this paper (prepared by Isao Higashimori and answered by Deirdre Wilson)were used to introduce a general discussion on relevance theory at the end of a RelevanceTheoryWorkshop organised by Yuji Nishiyama and Isao Higashimori at Keio University in March1996.We would like to thank Yuji Nishiyama and the other organisers of the Keio Conference ontheInterface between Grammar and Cognition, of which this Workshop formed a part. Many ofthequestions relate to changes proposed in the Postface to the second edition of Relevance(Sperber& Wilson 1995). Others relate to more general issues currently under discussion. We thoughtthem worth circulating as a contribution to that discussion.[PDFfile]
