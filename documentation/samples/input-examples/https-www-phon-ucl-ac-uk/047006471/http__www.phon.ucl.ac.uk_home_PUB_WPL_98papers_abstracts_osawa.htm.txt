UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)The emergence of the D system and thedemise of morphological case in English FUYO OSAWA In this paper I discuss the English NP and its diachronicdevelopment into DP via the introduction of a D system within nominals. Since NPs are inherently predicative, and N has aR(eferential)-role, thatR-role must be bound, if NP is to be used as an argument. Either a functionalcategory D or morphological case binds the R-role. Since there was no DP in OE,and the status of nominal projections was NP, morphological case bound theR-role. When morphological case disappeared, a syntactic D system wasintroduced to bind the R-role. Further evidence for this assertion is theabsence of gerund constructions in OE, since gerunds are one instantiation of aD system. [PDF file]
