UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) Whatâ€™s in an island?HANS VAN DE KOOT& ERIC MATHIEUThe primary aim of this paper is to argue that a unifiedapproach to strong and weak islands is misguided: strong and weak islands aredifferent phenomena, to be accounted for at different levels of representation.Our central claim is that a theory of locality that represents these islands inone level cannot capture the pattern of island sensitivity exhibited by thevarious grammatical dependencies. The relevant empirical difficulties areeasily overcome in an approach that treats strong islands as syntactic and weakislands as scope-related. We then attempt to answer the question whether scopeis represented at LF or later. In order to maintain the view that scope is anLF phenomenon, one has to demonstrate that strong islands are not due toproperties of LF but have their origin in the order of syntactic operations ina derivational syntax. We show that such derivational theories of strong islandphenomena have major shortcomings. This strongly suggests that scope is not anLF phenomenon.[PDF file]
