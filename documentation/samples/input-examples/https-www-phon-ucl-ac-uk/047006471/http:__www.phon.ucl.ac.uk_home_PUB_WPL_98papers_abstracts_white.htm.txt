UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Syntax-LF mapping and the internalstructure of comparatives JONATHAN R. WHITE The change to a minimalist approach to syntax makes usconsider whether previously assumed processes are necessary, including May'sQuantifier Raising rule. Following Fox (1995), I argue from the domain ofEnglish comparatives, whose degree heads are assumed to be quantifiers, that QRonly takes place when base-generated scope relations are changed. Comparativesare analysed as discontinuous heads, whose outer head position encodes thebase-generated scopal order. After presenting some arguments about thecomplement of the second head, I present evidence that further raising of thedegree head is needed. [PDF file]
