Abstract: CarstonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Enrichment and loosening: complementary processes in deriving the propositionexpressedROBYN CARSTONAbstractWithin relevance theory the two local pragmatic processes of enrichment and loosening oflinguistically encoded conceptual material have been given quite distinct treatments.Enrichmentsof various sorts, including those which involve a logical strengthening of a lexical concept,contribute to the proposition expressed by the utterance, hence to its truth-conditions.Loosenings, including metaphorical uses, do not enter into the proposition expressed by theutterance or affect its truth-conditions; they stand in a relation of 'interpretive resemblance'withthe linguistically encoded concept used to represent them. This asymmetric treatment isquestioned here, arguments are given for an account which reflects the complementarity oftheseprocesses and several alternative symmetrical treatments are explored.[PDFfile]
