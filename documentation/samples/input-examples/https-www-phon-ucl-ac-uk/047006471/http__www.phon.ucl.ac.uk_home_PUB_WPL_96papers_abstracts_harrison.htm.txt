Abstract: HarrisonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)An experiment with tonePHIL HARRISONAbstractIt has been previously claimed that identical phonological objects are componential inphonationcontrasts and lexical tone. It has also been shown that infants perceive language-specificphonation contrasts. We here investigate the perception of lexical tone by an adult speaker ofYoruba to allow us to both design stimuli and form hypotheses for infant testing. Twoimportanttheoretical points are discussed: firstly, that prosody and melody, which remain independentthroughout adult life, must undergo separate developments; and secondly, that the insertion ofidentical melodic material into different structural architecture may lead to different phoneticoutputs.[PDFfile]
