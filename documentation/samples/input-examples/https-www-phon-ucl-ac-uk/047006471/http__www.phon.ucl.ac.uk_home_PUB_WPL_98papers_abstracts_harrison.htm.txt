UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Yoruba babies and unchained melodyPHIL HARRISONEarlier work on the perception of stop contrasts by infantsand of lexical tone by Yor—b  adults sets thecontext for the results presented here, which demonstrate the sensitivity ofsix- to eight-month old Yor—b  babies to thetonal contrasts of their native language. Like adult speakers, theydiscriminate high tone from other tones in a single nuclear domain, but fail todiscriminate mid from low tone. English-acquiring controls remain completelyuninterested in such distinctions. These findings are readily aligned with thecharacterisation of melodic objects as privative elements, and so lendpsycholinguistic credence to this model and provide evidence of the acquisitionof laryngeal phonological contrasts in the first year of life.
