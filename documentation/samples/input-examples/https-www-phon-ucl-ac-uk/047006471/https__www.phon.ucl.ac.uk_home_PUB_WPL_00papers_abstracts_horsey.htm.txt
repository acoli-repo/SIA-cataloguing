UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Meaning postulates and deferenceRICHARD HORSEYFodor (1998) argues that most lexical concepts have no internal structure. Herejects what he calls Inferential Role Semantics (IRS), the view that primitiveconcepts are constituted by their inferential relations, on the grounds thatthis violates the compositionality constraint and leads to an unacceptable formof holism. In rejecting IRS, Fodor must also reject meaning postulates. Iargue, contra Fodor, that meaning postulates must be retained, but that whensuitably constrained they are not susceptible to his arguments against IRS.This has important implications for the view that certain of our concepts aredeferential. A consequence of the arguments I present is that deference isrelegated to a relatively minor role in what Sperber (1997) refers to asreflective concepts; deference has no important role to play in the vastmajority of our intuitive concepts.
