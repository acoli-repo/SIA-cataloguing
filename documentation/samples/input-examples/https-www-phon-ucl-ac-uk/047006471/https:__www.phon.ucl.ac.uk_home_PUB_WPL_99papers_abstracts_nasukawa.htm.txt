UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Prenasalisation and melodic complexityKUNIYA NASUKAWAIn the northern Tohoku dialect of Japanese (Kanai 1982), it has been assumedthat the melodic structure of prenasalised plosives is more complex than thatof voiced plosives. This paper questions that view, however, calling upon theargument that prenasalisation occurs only in truly voiced plosives in anintervocalic environment. The analysis refers to the principle of LicensingInheritance (Harris 1994, 1997), and examines its influence on the headshipstatus of the nasal prime (Nasukawa 1998).[PDF file]
