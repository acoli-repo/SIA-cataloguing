UCLWPL 9 abstracts: WhiteUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Result clauses and the structure of degreephrasesJONATHAN R. WHITEI am concerned here with the structure of Degree Phrases which introduce Result clauses.Afterdemonstrating that degree words select these clauses, I look at some previous proposalsregardingthis structure. I consider Abney's (1987) account, an extraposition-based version usingJackendoff's (1977) work, and finally Baltin (1987), which involves both selection andextraposition. Next, I introduce my proposal, that functional categories can project shells, andanalyse Degree Phrases in this way. Lastly, I propose a possible semantic analysis, which isintended to demonstrate that my syntactic account is superior to the others.[PDF file]
