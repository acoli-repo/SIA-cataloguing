UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Violable principles and typologicalvariationPHILLIP BACKLEYIn the Government-based literature, all structuralprinciples supplied by UG are, without exception, assumed to exert theirinfluence over every well-formed representation. We do find cases, however,where two principles that appear to be universally applicable make opposingpredictions as to the grammaticality of a given structure. To resolve suchinstances of principle clash, I propose a localised form of principle rankingwhereby a principle may be violated in order to allow a more highly rankedprinciple to make its contribution to grammaticality. I show how theincorporation of ranking into a principles-based model can make usefulpredictions concerning typological variation within ATR harmony systems. [PDF file]
