Abstract: EvansUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Event variables and Davidson's program in semanticsBARRIE EVANSAbstractThe use of predicate logic to represent the linguistic portrayal of events, in which the eventitselfis treated as a variable, was proposed by Reichenbach in the 1940's and extended byDavidson1980. The paper extends this analysis of events and the logical form associated with it,makinguse of some recent ideas in Higginbotham 1995, so that the semantics associated with Englishverbs can be handled more fully. The paper also applies the application of this expandedlogicalform to a language family in West Africa, which has a verb morphology very different fromthatof European languages.[PDFfile]
