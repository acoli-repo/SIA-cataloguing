Abstract: CurcóUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)The implicit expression of attitudes, mutual manifestness and verbal humourCARMEN CURCÓAbstractThis paper argues that intentional humour often consists in implicitly expressing an attitudeofdisengagement towards an attributable assumption which is made strongly mutually manifestbythe implicit import of an utterance, and suggests that such cases should be regarded asinstancesof echoic use. The role of the entertainment of the incongruous in the recovery of a humorousinterpretation is discussed, and the status of the notion of incongruity in a theory of verbalhumour is reconsidered. The analysis proposed here accomodates humorous cases of verbalironyas sub-cases of the generalization suggested and separates in a principled way those which arenot.[PDFfile]
