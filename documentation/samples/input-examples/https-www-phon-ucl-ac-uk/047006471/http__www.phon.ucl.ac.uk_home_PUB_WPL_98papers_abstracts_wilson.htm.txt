UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Recent approaches to bridging: Truth,coherence, relevance DEIRDRE WILSON & TOMOKO MATSUI This paper considers three recent approaches to bridgingreference, based on notions of truth, coherence and relevance, and argues thata relevance-based approach to bridging is preferable on both descriptive andexplanatory grounds. Using questionnaire results from Matsui 1995, it comparesthe predictions of the relevance-theoretic account with several versions oftruth- based and coherence-based approaches, and shows how the intuitionsbehind these approaches might be explained on a relevance-theoretic account.
