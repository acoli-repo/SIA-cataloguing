Abstract: Smith & TsimpliUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)  Modules and quasi-modules: language and theory of mind in a polyglot savantNEIL SMITH & IANTHI-MARIA TSIMPLIAbstractIn this paper we provide further evidence from the polyglot savant, Christopher, for the natureof Theory of Mind. In particular, we exploit a distinction between modules as classicallydefined (Fodor, 1983), and 'quasi-modules'. While the latter have the domain-specificity ofmodules, they are not informationally encapsulated and they exploit a non-perceptualvocabulary.  We report the results of his performance on a variety of false belief tasks,showing that differences inherent in the various tasks allow for an explanation of hisapparently inconsistent behaviour, which in turn provides evidence for the 'quasi-modularity'of his Theory of Mind.[PDFfile]
