UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)The deferred interpretation of indexicals and proper names GEORGE POWELL One of the central tenets of direct reference theory, that indexicals are semantically marked so as to give rise tosingular propositions, has recently been challenged, by Geoffrey Nunberg among others, on the grounds that indexicals can, in fact, be shown to lead to the same rangeof interpretations as descriptions. In this paper I want to take a look atso-called deferred interpretations of indexicals andproper names from a cognitive perspective grounded in Relevance Theory, withthe aim of exploring what râ€œles semantic decoding andpragmatic inference play in the retrieval of these interpretations.
