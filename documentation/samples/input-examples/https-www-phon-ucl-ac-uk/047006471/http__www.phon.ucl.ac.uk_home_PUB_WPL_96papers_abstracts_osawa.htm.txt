Abstract: OsawaUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Missing arguments in earlier English clause structuresFUYO OSAWAAbstractThe purpose of this paper is to account for missing arguments in impersonal constructions inearlier English. Having examined all the proposals for accounting for the missing argumentsinline with the discussion of such arguments in early child English, we saw that all of them hadpotential problems. I proposed a new view that the missing arguments were not missing, butsimply did not exist in a given argument structure from the beginning, because the earlyclauseis completely thematically constructed. Only arguments which are required by the meaning ofthe predicate have to be syntactically realized.[PDFfile]
