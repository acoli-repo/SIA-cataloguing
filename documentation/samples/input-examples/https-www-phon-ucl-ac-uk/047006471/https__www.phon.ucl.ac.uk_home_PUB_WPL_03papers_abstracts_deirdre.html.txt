UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) New directions for research onpragmatics and modularityDEIRDRE WILSONThis paper considers the relation between the pragmaticabilities used to interpret communicative behaviour and more general mind-readingabilities used to interpret ordinary actions. According to the classical Fodorian view (Fodor 1983),pragmatics and mindreading are central cognitivesystems which are used to attribute mental states to others on the basis ofgeneral-purpose reasoning abilities. I will outline an alternative, relevancetheoretic account on which mind-reading is adedicated inferential module, and pragmatics is a sub-module of themind-reading module, with its own special-purpose principles andmechanisms.[PDF file]
