UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) Game theory and communicationNICHOLAS ALLOTTThis paper assesses recent game-theoretic accounts ofcommunication which are motivated by the goal of understanding links betweenrationality and communication, particularly PrashantParikhâ€™s model (Parikh 1991, 2000, 2001). Following an account of themodel, it is argued that it faces empirical and theoretical problems.Comparisons are made with relevance theory (Sperber& Wilson, 1986/95) and improvements to the model are suggested. Analternative kind of approach, represented by the work of Lewis (1969) and van Rooy (forthcoming) is briefly discussed, as are doubtsabout the formalisation of rationality offered by game theory.[PDF file]
