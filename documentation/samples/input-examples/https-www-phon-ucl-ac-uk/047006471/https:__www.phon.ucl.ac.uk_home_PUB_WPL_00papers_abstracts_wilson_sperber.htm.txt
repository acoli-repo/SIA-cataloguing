UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Truthfulness and RelevanceDEIRDRE WILSON & DAN SPERBERThis paper questions the widespread view that verbal communication is governedby a maxim, norm or convention of literal truthfulness. Pragmatic frameworksbased on this view must explain the common occurrence and acceptability ofmetaphor, hyperbole and loose talk. We argue against existing explanations ofthese phenomena and provide an alternative account, based on the assumptionthat verbal communication is governed not by expectations of truthfulness butby expectations of relevance, which are raised by literal, loose andmetaphorical talk alike. Sample analyses are provided, and some consequences ofthis alternative account are explored. [PDF file]
