UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)On the natureof French N-wordsERIC MATHIEUÂ The view defended in this paper is that French N-words areinherently negative. We argue that French N-words are not simple (i.e. NegativePolarity Items/pure variables), but negative indefinites: complex XPs consisting of a phonologically null negative operatorand an indefinite expression. French negative statements with N-words areinstances of scope marking chains in which the null operator is a sub-extractedadjunct. The latter moves to the specifier of a Neg phrase so that negation can take scope over therelevant predicate while the indefinite expression is stranded.[PDF file]
