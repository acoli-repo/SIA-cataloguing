UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)M-selection and phrasal affixationPETER ACKEMA & AD NEELEMANIn this paper we argue that selectional properties of affixes should bedistributed across a morphosyntactic AFFIX and a morphophonological /affix/.The AFFIX selects a node with particular categorial features, but it does notspecify an X-bar theoretical level. The /affix/ selects a head (or moreprecisely phonological word), but it does not care about syntactic category.Traditional m-selection (that is, selection of a head of a particular category)can only obtain if the AFFIX corresponds to an /affix/. In other circumstances,the AFFIX may freely attach to a syntactic phrase. This gives some insight intoeffects of zero affixation, certain types of bracketing paradoxes and so-called‘mixed categories’. [PDF file]
