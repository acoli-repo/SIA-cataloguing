UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Relevance and rationalityNICHOLAS ALLOTT Subjects’ poor performance relative to normativestandards on reasoning tasks has been supposed to have ‘bleakimplications for rationality’ (Nisbett & Borgida, 1975).More recent experimental work suggests that considerationsof relevance underlie performance in at least some reasoning paradigms (Sperberet al., 1995; Girotto et al.,2001; Van derHenst et al., 2002). It is argued here that this finding has positive implicationsfor human rationality since the relevance theoretic comprehension procedure iscomputationally efficient and well-adapted to the ostensive communicativeenvironment: it is a good example of bounded and adaptive rationality inGigerenzer’s terms (Gigerenzer and Todd, 1999), and, uniquely, it is afast and frugal satisficing heuristic which seeks optimal solutions.[PDF file]
