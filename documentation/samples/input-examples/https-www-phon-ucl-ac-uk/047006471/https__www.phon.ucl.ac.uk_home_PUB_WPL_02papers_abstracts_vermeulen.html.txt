UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Ga ga constructions inJapaneseREIKO VERMEULEN The Japanese nominative particle ga can mark a subject, apossessor of a subject, an adjunct and the object of a stativepredicate.  A prevalent view is that atensed head licenses more than one nominative phrase in multiple specifier or adjoined positions in one projection (Heycock 1993, Ura 1996, amongothers).  I argue, however, that such ahead licenses exactly one nominative phrase and that proxycategories are created for multiple licensing (Nash & Rouveret 1997).  Thedistribution of gais further regulated by an interpretational rule that treats it as a focusparticle in sentence-initial position.[PDF file]
