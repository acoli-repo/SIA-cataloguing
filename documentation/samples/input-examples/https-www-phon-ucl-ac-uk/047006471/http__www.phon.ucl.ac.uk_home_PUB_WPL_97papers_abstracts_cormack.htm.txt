UCLWPL 9 abstracts: Cormack & SmithUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Checking features and splitsignsANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITHSerial and quasi-serial constructions pose an interesting problem for Checking Theory, as theinflectional morphology relating to Tense may appear on two verbal heads. We argue that aheadmay occur as a 'split sign', with its LF-interpretable and PF-interpretable parts merged atdifferentpositions in a derivation. The PF-interpretable part determines the morphology on V, theLF-interpretable part determines the appropriate interpretation. We show that Tense mustcheckone or more accessible Infl heads: that is, checking is not essentially one to one, and the partsof asplit sign are subject to checking in a configuration which may be non-local.[PDF file]
