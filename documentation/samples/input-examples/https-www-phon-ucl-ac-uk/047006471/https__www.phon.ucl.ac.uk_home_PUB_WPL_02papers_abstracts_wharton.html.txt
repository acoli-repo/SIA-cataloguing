UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Paul Grice, saying and meaningTIM WHARTON The notions of ‘saying’and ‘what is said’ are fundamental to Paul Grice’s work. Thispaper argues, however, that the versions of these notions most often attributedto Gricemay not be the ones he intended. Tosupport this claim, I examine the original typescripts of Grice’s WilliamJames Lectures, and discuss comparisons made by fellow Griceanresearcher—Bob Arundale—between thelectures, original published versions of the lectures and revised versionsincluded in Grice (1989). I also discuss similarities between Grice’snotions and the notion of ‘dictiveness’introduced by a contemporary of his at Oxford—R. M. Hare.[PDF file]
