UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Metarepresentation in linguisticcommunicationDEIRDRE WILSONThis paper is designed to illustrate and consider the relations between three typesof metarepresentational ability used in verbal comprehension: the ability tometarepresent attributed thoughts, the ability to metarepresent attributedutterances, and the ability to metarepresent abstract, non-attributedrepresentations (e.g. sentence types, utterance types, propositions). Aspectsof these abilities have been separately considered in the literatures on"theory of mind", Gricean pragmatics and quotation. The aim of thispaper is to show how the results of these separate strands of research might beintegrated with an empirically plausible pragmatic theory.  [PDF file]
