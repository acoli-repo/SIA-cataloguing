UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Fronting: The syntax and pragmatics of‘focus’ and ‘topic’ANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITHWe argue on conceptual and empirical grounds that there are no dedicated Topicand Focus heads. Instead, we postulate two semantically trivial heads, Gapand Fon, which may be merged in the left periphery, with distinctsyntactic and morphological properties. Gap is a Case assigner; Fonmorphologically selects for the PF-interpretable part of some sign. These headscan be exploited to front phrases which may be pragmatically interpreted astopic or focus. We further argue that the two fronting mechanisms postulatedcan explain certain properties of NPI licensing in English, where CopyMovement, with or without movement in the PF component, cannot.
