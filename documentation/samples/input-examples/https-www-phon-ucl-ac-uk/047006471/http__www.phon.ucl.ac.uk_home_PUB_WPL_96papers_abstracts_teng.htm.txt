Abstract: TengUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Aspectuals in Cantonese: the case of SaaiYU-YAN ANNE TENGAbstractThis paper argues that saai in Cantonese is an aspectual suggesting the completeness ofan event. The property of being a totally completed event provides a cue for processing the divisibility  or  numerousness  of the subject or object noun phrases. However, if the notion ofcompleteness is the only relevant piece of information in the ongoing communication, there isno need to infer the status of the noun phrase. When  saai  is used in a predicate with an affectedobject, the fulfillment of every stage of the event indirectly brings out telicity in this type ofpredicate.[PDFfile]
