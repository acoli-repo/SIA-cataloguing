Abstract: Cormack & SmithUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Checking theory: features, functional heads, and checking-parametersANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITHAbstractStructures with subordinating conjunction, covert or overt, provide evidence for checkingtheory,and offer an interesting testing ground for the theory of feature checking, and for theories oftheinterpretation of inflectional morphology and the lexicon. We argue for a radicallyseparationalistaccount of verbal inflection.  Certain functional heads (which have no phonological content)needto be in an appropriate checking relation with one or more appropriate morphophonologicaloperators on lexical heads, within the syntactic structure. The checking configuration isparametrised, taking one of the values 'head check', 'scope-check' and 'asymmetric check',wherechecking is 'at a distance' rather than under the higher head.[PDFfile]
