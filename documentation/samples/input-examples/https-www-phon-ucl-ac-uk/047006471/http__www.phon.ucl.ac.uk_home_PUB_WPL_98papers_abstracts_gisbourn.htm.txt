UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)The attributarystructure, evidential meaning, and the semantics of English SOUND-class verbs Nikolas Gisborne This paper discusses a class of English verbs which expressa kind of evidential modality and which display a unique kind of predicativecomplementation, which is here called the "attributary"structure.
