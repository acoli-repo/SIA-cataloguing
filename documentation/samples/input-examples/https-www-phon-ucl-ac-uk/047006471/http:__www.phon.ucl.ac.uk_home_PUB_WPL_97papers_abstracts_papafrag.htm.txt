A number of researchers have claimed thatrootmeanings are acquired earlier than epistemic ones; this claim has subsequently beenemployedinthe linguistics literature as an argument for the position that English modal verbs arepolysemous(Sweetser 1990). In this paper I offer an alternative explanation for the later emergence ofepistemic interpretations by liniking them to the development of the child's theory of mind(Wellman 1990). If correct, this hypothesis might have important implications for the shapeofthesemantics of modal verbs.[PDF file]
