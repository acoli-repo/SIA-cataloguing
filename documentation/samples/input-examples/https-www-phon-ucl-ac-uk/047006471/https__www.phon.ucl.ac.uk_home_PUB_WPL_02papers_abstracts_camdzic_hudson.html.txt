UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002)  Serbo-Croat-Bosnian clitics and Word GrammarAMELA ČAMDŽIĆand RICHARD HUDSON Serbo-Croat-Bosnian has a complex system of clitics which raise interesting problems for any theory ofthe interface between syntax and morphology. After summarising the data wereview previous analyses (mostly within the generative tradition), all of whichare unsatisfactory in various ways. We then explain how Word Grammar handles clitics: as words whose form is an affix rather than theusual ‘word-form’. Like other affixes, cliticsneed a word to accommodate them, but in the case of cliticsthis is a special kind of word called a ‘hostword’.We present a detailed analysis of Serbo-Croat-Bosnianclitics within this theory which covers more of thedata than any other analysis.[PDFfile]
