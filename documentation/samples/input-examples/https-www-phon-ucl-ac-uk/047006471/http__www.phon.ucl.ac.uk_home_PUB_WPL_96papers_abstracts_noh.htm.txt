Abstract: NohUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)A relevance-theoretic account of metarepresentative uses in conditionalsEUN-JU NOHAbstractThe purpose of this paper is to give a relevance-theoretic account of certain 'non-basic'indicativeconditionals. There has been a claim (e.g. Grice 1989) that natural language if issemantically identical with material implication in logic. This approach runs into someproblems,one of which is that some natural-language conditionals do not appear to involve the requiredtruth-functional relation between antecedent and consequent. I attempt to show that therelevance-theoretic notions of metarepresentation and pragmatic enrichment (Carston 1988,Wilson and Sperber 1992) allow us to preserve the view that if is equivalent to materialimplication.[PDFfile]
