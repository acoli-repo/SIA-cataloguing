UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) Truth-conditionalcontent and conversational implicatureROBYN CARSTONAccording to some pragmatists, certain conversationalimplicatures of an uttered sentence may be composed into the truth-conditionalcontent of more complex constructions (e.g. conditionals or comparatives) inwhich that sentence is embedded. I present two arguments against this view, theone based on the intuitive (in)validity of arguments couched in naturallanguage, the other on the (in)cohence ofconversational exchanges; the view in question makes some wrong predictions inboth cases. My positive position is that processes of pragmatic enrichment oflinguistically encoded meaning (as distinct from conversationalimplicatures) affect thetruth-conditional content of utterances of not only the complex constructionsbut also of the simpler embedded sentences.[PDFfile]
