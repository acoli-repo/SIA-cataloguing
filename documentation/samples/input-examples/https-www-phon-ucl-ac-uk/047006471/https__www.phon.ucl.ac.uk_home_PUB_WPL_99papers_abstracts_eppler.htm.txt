UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Word order in German-English mixeddiscourseEVA EPPLERIntrasententially code-switched data pose aninteresting problem for syntactic research as two grammars interact in oneutterance. Constituent-based models have been shown to have difficultiesaccounting for mixing between SVO and SOV languages like English and German. Inan analysis of code-switched and monolingual subordinate clauses, I show thatcode-mixing patterns can be studied productively in terms of a dependencyanalysis whi c h recognises words but not phrases.That is, each word in a switched dependency satisfies the constraints imposedon it by its own language. Quantitative methodologies, in addition to thedependency analysis, are essential because some of the influences o fcode-switching are probabilistic rather than absolute.  [PDF file]
