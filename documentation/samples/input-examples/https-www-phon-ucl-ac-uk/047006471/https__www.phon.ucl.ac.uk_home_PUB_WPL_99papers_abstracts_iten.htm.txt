UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) The relevance of Argumentation TheoryCORINNE ITEN In this paper, I examine Argumentation Theory (AT), a semantic framework bestknown for its detailed analyses of expressions with non-truth-conditionalmeaning, such as but and even. I sketch the development ofthe theory from its inception in the mid/late 1970s to the present day and Iexamine the basic AT notions and some of the theory's implications. In the lastsection, I discuss some problems with AT, e.g. its lack of a principledsemantics/pragmatics distinction and its inability to explain why language is,quite routinely, used to convey information about the world. I then brieflysuggest how a cognitive theory with a principled semantics/pragmaticsdistinction, such as Relevance Theory, can avoid the most serious problemsencountered by AT.   [PDF file]
