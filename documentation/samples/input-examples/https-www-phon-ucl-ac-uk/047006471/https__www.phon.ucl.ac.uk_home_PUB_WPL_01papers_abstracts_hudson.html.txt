UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Clitics in Word Grammar DICK HUDSON Clitics are a challenge for any view of the architecture ofgrammar because they straddle the boundaries between words and morphemes andbetween syntax and morphology. The paper shows that cliticsare syntactic words which also serve as word-parts, so their presence isexplained in terms of syntactic dependencies, but their position followsmorphological rules. The general analytical framework which is proposed buildson the theory of Word Grammar. As expected, cliticsdo demand a collection of special analytical categories - the word-classes Clitic and Hostword, and therelationships ‘host’, ‘clitic’,‘finite verb’ and ‘extension’ - but (unlike othercurrent theories of cliticization) they do not needany extra theoretical apparatus. The paper considers simple cliticsin English and special clitics in French and Serbo-Croat.[PDF file]
