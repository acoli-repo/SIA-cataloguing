UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)DP-internal VP movement TANMOY BHATTACHARYA In this paper I show that there are clause-like NP-movementswithin the DP. There have been various proposals for N-movement within the DP(Bernstein 1993, Longobardi 1994 etc.) but noneconcerning NP-movement. I show that in Bangla(Bengali) at least two types of DP- internal NP movements take place, both ofwhich are due to specificity. The analysis offered, in terms of a differencebetween nP and NP movement, additionally derives theresult that the deixis obtained in phrases where theNP has moved leftward, is non-locative. [PDF file]
