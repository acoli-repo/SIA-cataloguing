UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003)  LF complex predicate formation: thecase of participle fronting in Serbo-Croatian PETER ACKEMA & AMELA ČAMDŽIĆWe argue that cases of so-called long head movement inSerbo-Croatian, in which a participle precedes an auxiliary, involve complexpredicate formation in covert syntax (LF). Following Wilder & Ćavar (1994) and Bo.ković(1995, 2001), we analyse these cases not as involving actual long headmovement, but rather as head-to-head adjunction of the lower verb to the higher(verb clustering). Contrary to what these authors assume, however, we arguethat, exceptionally, it is the participle that is merged as the higher verb,the auxiliary as the lower one. The auxiliary adjoins to the participle at LF.Any arguments can be licensed by the thematic properties of the participle,despite being merged in a lower phrase, as a result of the formation of a complexpredicate consisting of participle and auxiliary at LF, the level where the theta-criterionis checked. This analysis provides an explanation for the verb clustering thatdoes not occur in general in Serbo-Croatian, and makes possible a straightforwardaccount of the word order possibilities in cases of verbal complexes with threeverbs, of the fact that elements that are high in the structure block participlefronting whereas elements that are lower in the structure do not, and of certaingapping data.[PDF file]
