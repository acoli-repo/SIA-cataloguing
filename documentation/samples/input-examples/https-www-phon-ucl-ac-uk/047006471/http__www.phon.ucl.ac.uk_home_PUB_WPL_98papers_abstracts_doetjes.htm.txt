UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Degree expressions and the autonomy ofsyntaxJENNY DOETJES, AD NEELEMAN & HANS VAN DE KOOTThis paper argues for the autonomy of syntax. So-calleddegree expression come in two sorts: some are heads selecting an AP, others are adjoined to any suitable host. These twoclasses yield to a unitary semantics, which explains their largelycomplementary distribution. Hence, they can only be distinguished in syntacticterms, in particular c-selection. A further argument for an autonomous syntaxcomes from cases in which degree expressions are not in complementarydistribution. It is demonstrated that the syntactic relation of specifier-headagreement explains such cases, and that this explanation cannot be reduced to asemantic fact. [PDF file]
