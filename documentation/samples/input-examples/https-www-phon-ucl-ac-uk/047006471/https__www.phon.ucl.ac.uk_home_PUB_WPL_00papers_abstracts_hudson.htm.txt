UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Gerunds and multiple defaultinheritanceDICK HUDSONIn general, English gerunds such as (We were talking about) John having asabbatical combine the internal characteristics of a clause with theexternal characteristics of a noun phrase. Previous analyses have tried torecognise the mixed character of gerunds by assigning them two separate nodes,one verbal and the other nominal, but all such analyses are problematic. Thispaper proposes an analysis similar to that of Malouf (1998) in which the verbaland nominal classifications are combined on a single node, and argues that thenode can in fact inherit, by multiple default inheritance, from both thesupercategories without any conflict. This is possible because ‘noun’ and‘verb’ (as opposed to their respective sub-classes) place orthogonalrestrictions on the phrase that they head: ‘noun’ restricts its externaldistribution, while ‘verb’ restricts its internal structure. (The analysis isexpressed in terms of Word Grammar, so these facts are actually expressed interms of dependencies: ‘noun’ and ‘verb’ appear only in restrictions ondependents and parents respectively.) The analysis is extended to explain somedetails of gerunds which confuse this very simple picture. On the one hand, alimited range of determiners is possible: a ‘possessive’ subject (e.g. aboutJohn’s having a sabbatical) or no in prohibitions or existentials(e.g. No playing loud music! There’s no mistaking that voice). And onthe other hand, a very few constructions demand a gerund rather than a nounphrase (e.g. It’s no use..., They prevented us from...). [PDF file]
