UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Complexdemonstratives GEORGE POWELL Are complex demonstratives (expressions of the form‘that F’) referring expressions or quantifiers? Their semanticbehaviour seems to pattern sometimes with the former, sometimes with thelatter. In this paper I examine both referential and quantificational accountsof complex demonstratives in order to show that neither side satisfactorilyaccounts for the all the data. I then outline an alternative analysis on which,although lexically univocal, complex demonstratives can give rise to genuinelysingular or genuinely quantificational truth conditions according to context.[PDF file]
