UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) A PRO-less theory of controlVIKKI JANKEIn this paper I present a theory of obligatory control whichis PRO free. The account is binding-based, but grounded in minimalistprinciples, in that it assumes an encoding of syntactic properties thatsatisfies Inclusiveness. The control relation is expressed in terms of howlexical semantic properties of a predicate are mapped onto lexical syntacticproperties. Its advantages are that it can derive the universal absence ofcontrolled objects as well as provide an answer for why the locality ofobligatory control resists any reduction to Shortest Move.[PDFfile]
