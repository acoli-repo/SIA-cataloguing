UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Although revisitedCORINNE ITENThis paper offers an analysis of the meaning of although set within theframework of Relevance Theory. In line with Iten (1998b), although isseen as encoding procedural information that constrains the inferentialprocesses involved in the derivation of implicatures. However, the currentaccount differs from Iten (1998b) in several points. First, it suggests thatutterances of the form Q although P or Although P, Q encode asingle logical form that can be developed into a single proposition expressed.Second, it proposes that the procedural meaning of although indicatesthat the hearer is to suspend an inference.
