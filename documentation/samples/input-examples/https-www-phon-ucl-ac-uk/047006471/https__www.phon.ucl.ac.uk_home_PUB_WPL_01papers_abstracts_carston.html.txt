UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Relevance Theory and the saying/implicatingdistinction ROBYN CARSTON A distinction between sayingand implicating has held a central place in pragmatics since Grice, with ‘whatis said’ usually equated with the (context-relative) semantic content ofan utterance. In relevance theory, a distinction is made between two kinds ofcommunicated assumptions, explicatures and implicatures, with explicaturesdefined as pragmatic developments of encoded linguistic meaning. It is arguedhere that, given a context-free semantics for linguistic expression types,together with the explicature/implicaturedistinction, there is no role for any minimally propositional notion of ‘whatis said’.[PDF file]
