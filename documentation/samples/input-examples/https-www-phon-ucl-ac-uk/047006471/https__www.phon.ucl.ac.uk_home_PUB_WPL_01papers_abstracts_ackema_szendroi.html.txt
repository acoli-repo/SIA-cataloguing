UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 13 (2001)Determiner sharing as an instance of dependentellipsis PETER ACKEMA & KRISZTA SZENDRŐI  In English coordinate ellipsis constructions, the determinerof a DP in the second conjunct can sometimes be omitted under identity with thedeterminer of the corresponding constituent of the first conjunct, a phenomenonknown as determiner sharing. Following Williams’s (1997) analysis ofnonconstituent ellipsis, we argue that determiner sharing involves a two-stepelision process: coordinate ellipsis plus a process we term dependent ellipsis.Dependent ellipsis is the process by which a coordinate null head licenses theheads of its direct dependents to be null as well. We show that, under thehypothesis that dependent ellipsis is not a transitive relation, the propertiesof determiner sharing constructions follow, adding some new observations tothose noted before in the literature. For example, we explain that subjectdeterminer sharing is usually only possible if Tense is gapped in the secondconjunct, while object determiner sharing is dependent on Verb-gapping.However, we also show that in certain cases subject D-sharing may be possiblewithout T-gapping and, vice versa, there are cases where T-gapping does notlicense subject D-sharing.
