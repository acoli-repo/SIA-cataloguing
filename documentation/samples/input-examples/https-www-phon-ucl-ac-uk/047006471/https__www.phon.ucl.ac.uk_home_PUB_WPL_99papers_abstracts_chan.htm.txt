UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Classifiers, demonstratives and classifier-to-demonstrativemovementBRIAN, HOK-SING,KUNIYA NASUKAWA, CHANThis paper examines the feature composition of Cantonese determiner-likeelements in the light of current literature (Cheng 1998, Cheng and Sybes ma, to appear, Li 1998, 1999a, b). It is argued thata combination of proposals in these works best captures the Cantonese facts. Inparticular, I argue for three specific positions: Firstly, classifiers, ratherthan demonstratives, are instantiations of D with a [referential] feature. Secondly,classifiers encode a [count] feature. Third, demonstratives encode a [definite]feature, but classifiers and numerals do not. What appears to be a bareclassifier phrase in Cantonese (i.e. without an overt numeral or demonstrative)is actually bound by a Dem node, which may be empty (resulting in an indefinitereading) or filled by the classifier which moves from the lower CL position.
