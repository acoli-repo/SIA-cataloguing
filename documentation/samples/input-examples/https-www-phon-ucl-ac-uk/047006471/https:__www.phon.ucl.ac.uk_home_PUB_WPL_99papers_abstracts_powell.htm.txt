UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) The referential-attributive distinction- a cognitive accountGEORGE POWELLIn this paper I approach the referential-attributive distinction in theinterpretation of definite descriptions, originally discussed by Donnellan (1966), from a cognitive perspective grounded in Sperber and Wilson'sRelevance Theory. In particular, I argue that definite descriptions encode aprocedural semantics which is neutral as between referential and attributivereadings, with each reading arising as a result of the differing links thatexist between different mental representations and the world, rather than as aresult of the differing links between language and mental representations.
