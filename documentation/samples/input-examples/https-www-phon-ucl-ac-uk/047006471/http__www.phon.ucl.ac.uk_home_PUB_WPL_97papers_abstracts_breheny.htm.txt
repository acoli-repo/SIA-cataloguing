The analysis proposed is an underdetermination account, where the universalforceof definites is understood not to be determined by the grammar, but is routinely inferred at thepragmatic level. The analysis assumes that the basic mechanism for interpreting definites isthesame as that for indefinites, but that the behaviour of definites is to be explained by referencetocertain non-truth-conditional properties of definites in combination with pragmaticprinciples.[PDF file]
