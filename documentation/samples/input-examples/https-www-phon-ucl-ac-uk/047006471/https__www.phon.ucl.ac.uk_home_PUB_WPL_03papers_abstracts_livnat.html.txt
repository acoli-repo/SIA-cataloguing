UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 15 (2003) On verbal irony and types of echoingZOHAR LIVNATThis paper examines the different types of echoing used inactual examples of verbal irony. The examples all contain an appositionalstructure, indicating an equivalence relation. This contributes to the ironicalinterpretation, and especially to recognizing the victim of the irony. I willargue, first, that syntactic structure may be a clue to indirect meaning;second, that echoic mention may play a role even when the echoed beliefs areonly implied; and third, that violations of Griceanmaxims of truthfulness and informativeness are more aclue to the presence of irony than an essential part of the analysis.[PDF file]
