Abstract: PolgárdiUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Constraint ranking, Government Licensing and the fate of final emptynucleiKRISZTINA POLGÁRDIAbstractGovernment Phonology is a principles-and-parameters approach where principles areinviolableand language-specific facts are expressed by parameters. Some analyses, however, have beenproposed which involve a conflict between different principles, resolved on alanguage-particularbasis (cf. Charette 1990, 1992, Cyran 1994). In this paper, using Government Licensing as anexample, I propose that such conflicts can be resolved by Optimality Theoretic ranking of thegiven  principles , rather than  turning them off  in a parametric style. This not only makes thegrammar simpler, but it also allows the lower ranked constraints to have an effect in a non-conflict situation. In addition, I propose to get rid of the (controversial) parameter licensingfinalempty nuclei, and show how this move, apart from other advantages, also simplifies theaccountof final consonant clusters.[PDFfile]
