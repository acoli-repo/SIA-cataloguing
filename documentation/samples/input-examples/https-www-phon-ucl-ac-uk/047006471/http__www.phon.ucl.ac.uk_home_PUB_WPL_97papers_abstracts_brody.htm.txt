UCLWPL 9 abstracts: BrodyUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)MirrortheoryMICHAEL BRODY The paper argues for a theory of syntactic structure in which there is no distinctionbetweenword and phrasal level categories: the same category will be interpreted as a head in somerespects and as a phrase in others. The theory takes the mirror principle to be axiomatic,analogous in status to the aspect of the projection principle that ensures that arguments of ahead are projected from the lexicon. Similarly to this principle, the syntactic complementstructure series is projected via the mirror principle from lexical-morphological word-internalstructure. Given the lack of a syntactic word/phrase distinction, subparts of extendedprojections can serve as the (only) syntactic representation of words.[PDF file]
