UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 14 (2002) Cantonese sentence-final particles andthe CP domainANN LAW  This paper proposestwo syntactic positions for the wide range of Cantonese sentence-final particlesthat occur in the CP domain.  The firstposition that I argue for is identified with the Force head (SFP1)of the C space (à la Rizzi1997) which hosts particles that express speech acts and speaker-orientedmodality.  The second position (SFP2)is an iterative head located lower than the higher Topic.  This proposal not only captures facts aboutthe co-occurrence and ordering restrictions of particle clusters, but also somepreviously unobserved behaviours of particles with quantified noun phrases anddifferent types of questions.[PDF file]
