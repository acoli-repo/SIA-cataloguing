UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 11 (1999) Why are depictivesdifferent from resultatives?ANNABEL CORMACK & NEIL SMITHWe analyse all of serial verbs, quasi-serials, depictivesand resultatives as complex predicate structuressemantically headed by the two-place asymmetric conj unction operator $. Thisuniformity necessitates an account of the fact that not all these $P behave inthe same way. Our analysis exploits (1) EVENTS,where some $P encode single-event structures, and some multiple event structures,and (2) parametric differences associated with the $ head. In addition weexploit (3) the notion of 'nil roles' and their case properties, and (4)iconicity at LF. Our evidence comes from English, Dutch, Nupeand Korean.  [PDF     file]
