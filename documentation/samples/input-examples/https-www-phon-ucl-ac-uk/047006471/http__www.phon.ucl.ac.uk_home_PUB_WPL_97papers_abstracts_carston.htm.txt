UCLWPL 9 abstracts: CarstonUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Relevance-theoretic pragmatics andmodularityROBYN CARSTONAn interesting issue for any mentalist approach to pragmatics is whether the utterancecomprehension system is an autonomous processor within the overall cognitive system orconsistsof processes carried out by an unencapsulated central inferencing system. Two approaches topragmatics which claim to involve modular subsystems in utterance understanding arediscussed(Barton's contextual submodules and Kasher's pragmatic competence systems) and theirmodularity claims are found to be unwarranted. Then, a recent shift within relevance theorytowards a modular view of pragmatics is outlined; some of the evidence supporting it, someofthequestions it raises and some of its implications are discussed.[PDF file]
