UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 12 (2000)Clitic doubling in Modern Greek: ahead-complement relationDIMITRA PAPANGELIThe hypothesis presented in this paper, namely that in clitic doublingconstructions the clitic selects for a DP-complement in Syntax, is motivated bythe need to explain the thematic problem raised in such constructions: Twoelements, the clitic and its double, compete for the same theta-role. It willbe argued that, in languages with an overt case affix on nouns, the clitic andits double may start out in a head-complement relation. The clitic may also becoreferential with a phrase in an adjunct position. In this case, though, therelation between the clitic and the double is one of coreference, establishedoutside the module of Syntax. [PDF file]
