UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Measuring the processing load ofJapanese wordsSO HIRANUMAA theory of processing difficulty (Hudson 1995, 1996b)grounded in Word Grammar (Hudson 1984, 1990) provides a means of computing thesyntactic difficulty for a sentence in terms of the distance of dependencies.The purpose of this paper is to determine relative processing loads forJapanese words - content words versus function words - in the hope of advancingthe method in such a way that syntactic difficulty will be measured with moreaccuracy. I shall illustrate through an experiment that in terms of memorycost, content words are essentially more expensive than function words. [PDF file]
