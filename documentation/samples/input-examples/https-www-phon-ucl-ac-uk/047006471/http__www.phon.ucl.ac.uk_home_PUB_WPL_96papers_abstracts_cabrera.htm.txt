Abstract: Cabrera-Abreu & MaidmentUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 8 (1996)Edge-licensing in chanting contoursMERCEDES CABRERA-ABREU & JOHN MAIDMENTAbstractThis paper looks at the manifestation of downstep in chanting contours, and at the way inwhichthis phenomenon has been accounted for by some models of intonation. Special attention ispaidto the analysis in Cabrera-Abreu (1996), where it is argued that toneless boundaries belongingto an empty nucleus are responsible for downstep in phonetic interpretation. However, thisproposal cannot be fully formalised unless a strategy is found to license such nuclei. Weproposehere that empty nuclei can be licensed by the edge of the intonation domain. This analysisallowsfor both a descriptively and an explanatorily adequate account of chanting contours.[PDFfile 1 | PDFfile 2 (graphics)]
