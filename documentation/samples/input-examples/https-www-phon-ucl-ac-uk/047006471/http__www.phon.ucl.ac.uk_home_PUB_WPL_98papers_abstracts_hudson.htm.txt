UCL Working Papers in Linguistics 10 (1998)Adjunct preposing,wh-interrogatives and dependency competition RICHARD HUDSON Adjuncts may occur (by adjunct preposing)before a wh-interrogative clause which is a mainclause, but not before one which is subordinate; for example: (i) Tomorrow what shall we do? (ii) I told you (*tomorrow)what we shall do. Why should adjunct preposing bedifferent in main and subordinate clauses? The pretheoreticalanswer is obvious: the wh-word must be initial in the subordinate clause that it introduces.However not all theories allow this insight to be expressed. A number ofpossible explanations based on standard assumptions are considered andrejected. The proposed solution is based on enriched dependency structure (WordGrammar) which does allow an analysis in which the wh-wordmust be initial in the subordinate clause but not in the main clause.
