UCLWPL 9 abstracts: KimUCL Working Papers in Linguistics 9 (1997)Agreement phrases inDPYOUNG-KOOK KIMIn this paper, assuming that there is an intermediate functional category called AgreementPhrase (AGRP) in DP, I arguethat an adnominal modifier such as a pre-nominal adjective or relative clause (RC) isbase-generated in Spec,AGRP. Inparticular, I distinguish between Restrictive Adnominal Modifiers (RAM) and Non-restrictiveAdnominal Modifiers(NAM), and argue that the NAM in head-final languages moves overtly out of the scope ofthe determiner to Spec,DP,while the NAM in head-initial languages moves covertly in LF. Finally I claim that themovement of the NAM to Spec,DPis due to a NON-FOCUS feature of the determiner and the NAM in terms of thefeature-checking theory (Chomsky 1995).[PDF file]
